'''
Script for searching for frequent abbreviations in a CONLL like corpus with
existing tags for abbreviations.
When specify a directory, all files in this directory will be read in and will
be analyzed. Output contains the accumulated results of every file.

Writes a list with amount of tokens and abbreviations including the 
abbreviation with their frequency in descending order.
